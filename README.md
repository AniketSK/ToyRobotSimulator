# ToyRobotSimulator
A fun coding test, [here's](https://joneaves.wordpress.com/2014/07/21/toy-robot-coding-test/) a brief history of its origins and how it's used to hire.

Demonstrates TDD (can verify this from the commits), git flow practises (without the dev branch for the purposes of this code challenge), and CI + code quality measuring tools.
